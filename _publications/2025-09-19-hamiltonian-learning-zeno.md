title: "Hamiltonian learning via quantum Zeno effect"
collection: publications
category: preprints
permalink: 'https://arXiv.org/abs/2509.15713'
excerpt: 'We propose a Hamiltonian learning protocol that leverages the quantum Zeno effect to reshape and localize system dynamics, enabling the extraction of local Hamiltonian coefficients, and demonstrate its feasibility by learning a 109-qubit Hamiltonian on IBM’s hardware.'
