collection: publications

excerpt: 'We implement a projective-simulation-based variational reinforcement learning algorithm on Quandelaâ€™s single-photon quantum computer. Using quantum walks of photons across tunable beamsplitters and phase shifters, we solve a benchmark task and demonstrate the potential of a quantum agent over a classical one.'
