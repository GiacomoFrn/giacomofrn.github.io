excerpt: 'Satellite image acquisition scheduling selects the optimal subset of images during an orbit pass under constraints. Although widely studied in AI and operations research, it has rarely been approached with quantum computing. We propose two QUBO formulations to handle the problem and test them on D-Wave quantum annealers and hybrid solvers across 20 benchmark instances.'
