excerpt: 'We show that optimizing indirect measurements in quantum reservoir computing improves execution time and overall performance. By tuning both the reservoir Hamiltonian and measurement strength across benchmarking tasks, we provide a practical approach for enhancing indirect measurement-based protocols.'
