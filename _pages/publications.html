I’m broadly interested in algorithms on and for quantum devices, with a focus on approaches that are experimentally friendly.
My work includes developing algorithms to verify and benchmark quantum simulators, with the goal of creating methods that are both practical and scalable for real-world devices.
In parallel, I study machine learning models implemented with quantum systems, where I have worked on the demonstration and interpretability of quantum projective simulation in single-photon devices and on the design of quantum reservoir computing protocols.
Earlier, during my Master’s, I also explored quantum optimization, focusing on how to encode higher-order optimization problems in the QUBO formalism.
