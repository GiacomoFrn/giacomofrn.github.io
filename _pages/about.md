I am a Ph.D. student in Quantum Information Theory (QIT) in the [group of Antonio Acín](https://www.icfo.eu/research-group/7/quantum-information/home/437/) at ICFO, in Casteldefells (Barcelona). I was awarded the [INPhINIT doctoral fellowship](https://lacaixafoundation.org/en/doctoral-inphinit-fellowships-incoming-call) in 2023 by the "la Caixa" Foundation. I’m broadly interested in algorithms on and for quantum devices, with a focus on approaches that are experimentally friendly.
